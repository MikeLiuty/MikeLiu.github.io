There are many devices inside and outside of the car, but mainly are three kinds of hardware:
* Sensors
* Processor
* Actuators

The sensors will detect the information and images on the road, then it will pass to the processor, after analyze and calculate, it will tell actuator where to go. By this process, the devices will collect the information from the sensors, for instance, other drivers behaviors, or other reliable problems. Besides the data from the devices, there are actually more data from outside, such as other cars and other systems. As some research by strategists, a Google self- driving car will make 1G data per second, so Google is still developing a better system to filter unnecessary data. After filter, the data needed will be collected to the cloud and share will other cars. By some programs created by Google, the car will automatically analyze and learn from the data. For the car, it will know when a cyclist wave left arm mean he will turn left; or will not always emergency brake and flashing light when a bird stand on the street. Also, from the data, the car will updates the new map all the time, because there is no company can get the real-time map, but the cars need it.
