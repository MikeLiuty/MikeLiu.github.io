## IoT has three main aspects, which are user's side, device's side and overview.

For the user side, the author mentioned the system need user's input, which means the system is based on human behaviour. In the IoT side, type of sensors, well-designed system, and the network of design will affect the final experience of the "thing". After all, the whole system need use the robustness principle as the basis, and above the level of a single device.

In my opinion, IoT is definitely the future. From 1999, the year of IoT term first coined by the director of Auto-ID centre, Kevin Ashton, the technology improved incredibly. With the ubiquitous of mobile devices, people are really living with technology at anytime and anywhere. Thereby, IoT trending quickly in recent years. From industry 4.0 to Uber app in our pocket, from Home Nest air conditioner system to the google self- driving car, every aspect of our life is changing. Besides, the commercial and technical are emerging into one ecosystem. Computer and the internet are not only a tool anymore, with the cloud, and virtualization, technology are changing people's life in any details. The most amazing thing is that it is just the beginning of the new generation, and there are more will be created in the future.

Along with the rapidly innovating of technology, the human had have created a huge amount of IoTs, which included good and bad.

As Tim O'Reilly said, "internet", "cloud", and "things" are not just words, they are a browse concepts related to many other concepts. According to the article, there are many of successful IoTs in the market already. In 2014, Gartner predicted that by 2020 there would be 25 billion connected devices. Cisco predicted that number would be closer to 50 billion, and Morgan Stanley thinks 75 billion.

## However, what is trending in IoTs right now?

1. The Platform is the key of IoT, as we can see, there are three categories of platforms right now. which are:
* Low- level device of device monitoring and management, security and firmware updates.
* Data collect, analyze, transformation and management.
* Application development, programming, visualization and system analytics.
2. Standard and Ecosystems:

There will be a conflict between commercial and technicals. In nowaday, a good idea of technology can make million dollars, and the product could extend to the traditional technology or non- technology areas.

3. Event stream processing. IoTs creates tens of event every day, by using distributed stream computing platform , people able to analysis the data in real-time.

4. There will be more and more operation system just work for specific proposes.

5. So far, design IoTs need the deep understanding of technical knowledge.

6. Current bandwidth of networks seems not working well for delivering data to IoTs, however, low- power wide-area networks (LPWANSs) and Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) are  better.

7. Low- power, short-range IoT network will be used. There will not be a single common infrastructure connecting devices.

8. The Device of management will be improved, which able to manage through multiple devices.

9. The approach to analytics will be improved as well since the volume of data is getting bigger and bigger rapidly.

10. Along with the IoTs, security will be a big problem with wide range challenges. However, the problem will be gradually solved by innovating of IoTs.

Consequently, all those trends also mean the issues in the current situation, such as not optimize network, too individually devices ( hardly communicate), and security. However, based on other technology experience, users and programmers can solve the problems by using the current knowledge. The increasing number of technology companies will have adequate support to the market. Besides that, using of big data in IoT is also potential, devices can analyze real-time data stream and predict  based on the current situation or history, just like most of the keyboards do. IoT concept is opening people's mind, and reminding people the cooperation of different technical can make ultimate future.
