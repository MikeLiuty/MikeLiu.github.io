According to the graph from "statistic.com", we can easily see Google's ad revenue from 2001 0.07 billion US dollars to 2015 67.39 billion US dollars, which have had rapidly increased. Compare to other search engines, we can see some differences between Google and others. The biggest difference is Google's ad are mostly customized by the individual user, which could be the main reason for users willing to click the ads on the page. So how Google's ad ranking system works? In the following Google supported website, there is a detail explanation and a video of Google Auction:

Basically, the ad ranking system contains many parts can influence the results and positions to display ads on the page. There are bids amount, ads qualities, formats impact. A better quality ad can improve the ranking and influence the real payment of the ad. In this way of ranking, Google can make advertisers spend more time and money to design better ads; also users will be happier to view ads on Google, and Google will receive more advertisers and users. By the brilliance design, the system will have a virtuous cycle.

However, is display on the search engine results page the only way Google display ads? At the last part of the video5, prof. Gottfried mentioned Google AdSense program, which can "use keyword matching engine to pick ads related to content on page". So in the blog of this week, I would like to have a brief introduction of the program.

## What is Google AdSense?

Google AdSense is a programme supported by Google allow publishers display ads from google on their websites or even a blog. According to the "Google Announces First Quarters 2014 results", 22% of total revenue is from Google AdSense.

## What are the benefits of Google AdSense?

* It can be used for all kind of website.( Without any family unfriendly content of course).
* The ads are family safe since they all provided by Google.
* Multiple websites can be used in one account.
* Publishers able to select ads related to the website contents.
* Publishers able to select ads categories and type to fit their website.
* Publishers able to select position to display the ads.
* Publishers able to modify the look of the text ads.
* The ads are mobile friendly automatically in any size of devices.
* The programme provides completed tutorial of pdf and YouTube videos, an efficiency help centre, and many help available online.
* Quick investment and set up, and free, why not to try?

With these benefits of Google AdSense program, publishers are able to modify many parts of the ads, but the contents of ads still random provided from Google by categories chosen by publishers.

## What type of ads publisher can use?

* Text ads.
* Videos ads.
* Image ads.
* HTML ads.

## How the Google AdSense count how much they will pay you?
Normally they pay either a per click or per impression basis.

## But everything has a good side and a bad side. Here are some main disadvantages of Google AdSense.

Even publishers are able to set the categories of the advertisements but still is randomly from Google.
From the above reason of disadvantage, a competitor's ad might appear on your website, which may take away your visitors.
Google AdSense is based on JavaScript. Google AdSense may make the website slower since it takes more resources to load the script. The users and visitors hate to wait, it can make them go away, especially when the first time we want to visit.
Google will share revenue with the publishers.

Conclusion. Google AdSense is really easy and useful  for small or even medium websites and blogs. But since Google will take part of the revenue from the ads, so maybe a larger website and blog owners; or some people want to get full revenue and full control of the ads should consider making their own ads sponsors.
