Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Answar:
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {

    for (var i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
        
         for (var e=i+1; e<nums.length; e++){

            if (nums[i] + nums[e] == target){

            return [i, e];

            }
        }
    }
};
